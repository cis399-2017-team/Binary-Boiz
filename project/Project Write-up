Goals: 
      Create a new instance for hosting our project server
      Create and maintain a webserver which hosts the open source software Paperwork (https://github.com/twostairs/paperwork/blob/master/README.md)
      
Use:
      Gives a set of users access to useful software which may help help with productivity
      Difficulties with using the software can be answered through the Paperwork documentation, or through our expanded knowledge through 
            working with the application.
      
Difficulties:
      Had to temporarily upgrade our instance's RAM to install and set up the software's dependencies
      
User Support Issues:

Security Issues:

Maintenance:
      To maintain this software we want to continually update it to the latest version. We would also want to keep backups of the user 
            data so that people who have made user accounts don't lose their information if we make a mistake when updating.
      Making backups could be automated with a time based Cron job.
