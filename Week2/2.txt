In the EC2 instance browser, find the instance you want the public IP for. There is a column labeled
public DNS(IPv4). Under this is your public IP. If you click your instance you will also be able to 
find it's public IP in the details tab.

It can also be retrieved from inside the instance by running the command:  
    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
